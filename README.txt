## Project Description
The Flight Delay Predict Chatbot is designed to predict flight delays based on historical flight data. It integrates various factors that influence flight delays, including:

- Flight number
- Airline
- Departure and arrival airports
- Scheduled departure and arrival times
- Actual departure and arrival times
- Weather conditions
- Day of the week
- Seasonal factors
- Holidays
- Historical delays for the same route
- Political factors

This project has significant potential to improve operational efficiency and passenger satisfaction, leading to potential cost savings and increased customer loyalty for airlines.

## Installation
To get started with the Flight Delay Predict Chatbot, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flight-delay-predict-chatbot.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd flight-delay-predict-chatbot

3.Install the necessary dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
To use the chatbot for predicting flight delays, follow these steps:

1. Prepare your dataset with the required fields.

2. Run the main application:
python app.py

3. Interact with the chatbot through the provided interface. Example:
User: What is the delay prediction for flight ABC123 on July 4th?
Bot: The predicted delay for flight ABC123 on July 4th is 15 minutes due to expected weather conditions.

## Features
Predict flight delays using historical flight data.
Integrate multiple factors influencing flight delays.
Provide real-time delay predictions through a chatbot interface.

## Data
The model uses a variety of data sources, including but not limited to:

- Flight schedules
- Weather data
- Holiday schedules
- Political events

## Model
The project utilizes machine learning techniques provided by libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn (sklearn) to train a predictive model. The model is trained on both historical and synthetic data to forecast future delays with a high degree of accuracy.
